## Lessons Learned

* I learnt to debug our code.
* While building clone of Grofers applicaiton we face so many error and understood so many errors like ActivityNotFoundException, ClassCastException, INSTALL_FAILED_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE, NullPointerException,R.layout.main Cannot Be Found, NetworkOnMainThreadException but now we understood it and if we fase these kind of error in the future instead of reading code line by line we can go the specific function and can resolve it.
* How to work and cummunicate with a team properly.
* How to be more efficient and productive at a same time.
